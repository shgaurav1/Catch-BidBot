# Predict if an online bid is made by a machine or a human

In this competition, you'll be chasing down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly 
frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core 
customer base is plummeting.

In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt 
at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven 
insufficient.

The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these 
users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.
